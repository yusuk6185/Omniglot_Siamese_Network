# Siamese_network
Siamese networks are neural networks that contain two or more identical subnetwork
components.
### In this repository, the Siamese network 
will be using two or more Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
as its subnetwork component. \
The network will be trained using the Omniglot dataset to predict 
whether the given inputs belong to the sameequivalence class.
